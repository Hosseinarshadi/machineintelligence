    "Let's first consider what summing and subtracting funcions entails. We start with two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that are different from each other. We are interested in computing their sum $f(x)+g(x)$. Let's introduce a geometric intuition of this problem. On the animation below, we see a small black triangle representing the variable $x$, sliding across the horizontal axis, oscillating between zero and some positive value. We also see three curves:\n",
    "- the green curve is a graph of the function $f(x)$\n",
    "- the blue curve is a graph of the function $g(x)$\n",
    "- the red curve is a graph of the sum $f(x)+g(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "What can these curves tell us about their respective functions?  The horizontal axis represents the input space of the function, while the vertical its output space. Each function joins a single value on the horizontal axis with a single value on the vertical axis. Repeating this for each value of input, is equivalent to tracing a curve on the two-dimensional plane. All three functions are dependent on the variable $x$, which means that for every $x$, each function has its own individual output. For some inputs, two functions might have the same output. In our example, when $x$ is equal to zero, the output of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ has the same valueâ€”zero. You can recognise this situation by looking at the graphs of two functions and recognising points where they intersect. Above the curves there are three vertical lines, whose lengths indicate the output value of each function as $x$ varies. What we can notice is that when the green line and the blue line point in the same direction (both function's output is either over or under the horizontal axis), their individual lengths __add__ into a lenght of the red curve. When the vertical lines are pointing in the opposite directions (one function outputs over the horizontal axis, the other under it), their lenghts cancel each other. We obtain the lenght of the red line by __subtracting__ one input length from another. "

    "To find an answer we need to introduce a slight change to the input of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, and evaluate how do their outputs change in terms of the input, for a smaller and smaller amount of change. In the animation below, the value $x$ on the horizontal axis is increased by the small amount $dx$ (the increase is made much larger on the drawing). For each function, its input values $x$ and $x+dx$, will have unique output values on the vertical axis. For example, the function $f(x)$ will yield the values $f(x)$ and $f(x+dx)$. We can use these values to construct a green triangle on the animation below. The points will mark its diagonals, and its height corresponds to tge change in the output $df$. The function $g(x)$ will yield the points $g(x)$ and $g(x+dx)$. We can use these two values to construct the blue triangle. Its height corresponds to the change in the output $dg$. The green and the blue triangle both have the same width ($dx$), therefore only their height varies. This allows us to make a parallel to our previous example. When the green triangle and the blue triangle point in the same direction (their changes in output are either both positive or both negative), their individual heights will add into the height of the red triangle, whose change in output will be of the same sign. When the heights of the triangles are pointing in the opposite directions (one change in output is positive, and the other one is negative or vice versa) their heights will cancel each other. We will obtain the height of the red triangle, by subtracting the height of one of the input triangles from another."

Since $sin(x)$ is a periodic function whose output oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, so will the width of the blue rectangle. Its height, on the other side will increase indefinitely with the increase of $x$. The question that we introduce with derivatives is how does the output $dh$ change as we increase the input value $x$ by a small amount $dx$.

First let's consider the change to the function $g(x)=x^2$ We can think of the function $x^2$ as the area of the square, like we did before. By increasing the $dx$, the change we obtained the change in area equal to $dg$ or $d(x^2)$. This change in area now becomes the amount by which we increase the height of our rectangle! Let's now consider the function $f(x)=sin(x)$. By increasing the value of $x$ for $dx$ the output of the function might decrease or increase, depending where on the function we are! If the slope of the function is positive at that point, the output will increase, and if it is negative, the output will decrease. We can denote the change of the output of the function $f(x)=sin(x)$ as $df$ or $d(sin(x)$.This now becomes the amount by which we increase (or decrease) the width of our rectangle.

This produces two new values in the vertical axis indicating a diagonal of a triangle. $dx$ is a change of input indicated with a purple horizontal line segment, the the $df$ or $d(x^2$) is the corresponding change of the function $f(x)=x^2$ indicated with a purple vertical line segment.
